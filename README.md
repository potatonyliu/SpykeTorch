SpykeTorch is a PyTorch-based simulator of convolutional spiking neural networks, in which the neurons emit at most one spike per stimulus. SpykeTorch supports STDP and Reward-modulated STDP learning rules. The current code is the early object oriented version of this simulator and you can find the documentation in docs folder in PDF format or in our lab website (http://cnrl.ut.ac.ir/SpykeTorch/doc/) in HTML format. Since SpykeTorch is fully compatible with PyTorch, you can easily use it if you know PyTorch. A tutorial is available in the paper titled "SpykeTorch: Efficient Simulation of Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks with at most one Spike per Neuron" which introduces the SpykeTorch package (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00625/full).

**IMPORTANT**: Current version of SpykeTorch does not support negative synaptic weights.

To setup this package, you can install Anaconda or Miniconda
```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/miladmozafari/SpykeTorch

# Create a new conda environment
conda create -n spyketorchproject python=3
conda activate spyketorchproject

# Install all the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
# Alternatively, one can just run the following command
pip install git+https://github.com/miladmozafari/SpykeTorch.git
```
To download and process the N-Caltech101 dataset:
```
python scripts/download_ncaltech101.py
```
**Static Datasets and Temporal Datasets**
The main feature of this fork compared to the original SpykeTorch library is that it added support to temporal datasets. The original library only support static datasets, which is defined as follow:
1. Once a spike occurs, it stays on until the end of the timesteps for the sample.
2. Ojbect and camera stays static, there is no optic flow.

Static datasets are generally generated from static images.

Dynamic datasets are event data with optic flow. This means event videos captured with event cameras with camera movement and / or object movements, a single pixel can spike, then goes back to 0 and repeat.
